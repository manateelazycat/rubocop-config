# What's this?

[RuboCop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is wonderful static code analyzer that keep my ruby code clean and standard.

[.robocop.yml](rubocop.yml) is my configure file for RuboCop.

You just need copy it's content to ~/.rubocop.yml and enable flycheck in Emacs, RuboCopy will teach you how to write standard ruby code. ;)
